## How it Works

1. **Upload an Image:** Choose an image by dropping it into the designated area or clicking to upload.

2. **Type a Prompt:** Enter a prompt or a description related to the image to guide the generative process.

3. **Click "Ask Gemini":** Interact with the "Ask Gemini" button to initiate the model and receive descriptive text based on the image and prompt.

## Tech Stack

- **Gradio:** Powering the user interface and enabling seamless interactions.
- **Google GenerativeAI (Gemini Pro Vision):** Driving the image description generation.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** Handling image processing.

## How to Use

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
